<strong>Growth Phase</strong> 
The Growth Phase is designed to help you scale your organization. Itâ€™s not enough to launch. Growth is critical. Without it, most startups die. We want to help you become sustainable. While less intensive than our Launch Phase, the Growth Phase is still vital to your success.</p>
