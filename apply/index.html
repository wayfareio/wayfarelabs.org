            <p>Wayfare Labs offers a few <a href="http://wayfarelabs.org/programs">distinct programs</a> to help you start piloting your idea, launch your organization, and grow your business into sustainable impact. We’re currently accepting applications for the Launch program. If you’re interested in the Growth program, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>. The Launch program starts twice per year, in the spring and fall (for more information on the program, <a href="/programs">see our details page</a>). Here’s what to expect when you apply:</p>

<p><strong>STEP 1: Complete an application online.</strong><br />
Tell us about your experience, your idea, and the team you’ve put in place. We’ll help guide you into the right program for your needs.</p>

<p><strong>STEP 2: Founder interviews.</strong><br />
If your application aligns with what we’re looking for, we’ll interview you and the other founders. This allows us to make sure you’re ready for the Launch Phase.</p>

<p><strong>STEP 3: Selections are made by the Wayfare Labs team.</strong><br />
After the interviews are complete, we have extensive conversations about who should be a part of our next batch.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Question: What are you looking for in startup applicants?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer:</strong> Everyone brings something different to the table, but in general, we’re looking for founders compelled by their faith to launch creation-restoring movements. What does that mean? It means we’re looking for people pursuing their calling to help solve the world’s problems.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Do you accept for-profits and non-profits?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer:</strong> Yes! While there are valid strategic reasons for choosing either status, we care more about how pursuit of the common good is integrated into your business model than we care about how the government views your entity. We’ll even help you decide how to structure your organization if you haven’t done it yet.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Why does the program cost money?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer:</strong> We strive to provide a valuable, personal experience for all our Labbers. That means putting together a killer program backed by a great team—which requires money. Some of that is subsidized by the donations we accept, but we also require startups to pay for the programs as a proof point of their ideas and their grit. Our programs include training on how to raise the funds, so don’t be too worried about the cost. If you have questions about how that will work, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and tell us about it!</p>

<p><strong>Question: How do I determine whether or not my startup or my idea is a good fit for this program?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer:</strong> The best way? Fill out and application or <a href="/contact">shoot us an email</a>. Most of the startups we bring into the program are early on in their history. Some are even just an idea written down on a napkin. Others are already piloting their product or service or have even been operating for several years. Most need help with their business models, fundraising, storytelling, and developing their mission and vision. Have a question? We’re here to help. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Question: May I apply for the Growth program?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer:</strong> Absolutely. The Growth program is customized for each startup, so we’d love to talk with you about your organization and current needs. <a href="/contact">Send us a message</a>, and we’ll chat.</p>

<p><strong>Question: I would love to support Wayfare Labs. How can I do that?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer:</strong> First off, thank you! There are a number of ways to support this work. Like any non-profit, we need financial support—head over to our <a href="http://wayfarelabs.givingfuel.com/general-fund">giving page</a> donate. If you’ve founded a startup, you might be a good fit to join our advisor network. If you’re not a founder but you do have expertise in another area. You can still volunteer by teaching one of our workshops.<br />
Finally, if you know a founder or startup who’d be a good fit for one of our programs, we’d love the referral.<br />
