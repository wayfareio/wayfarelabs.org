**Our Vision and Dream**  
Our dream is that leaders across the world would work together to build cities where even the most vulnerable flourish. We envision leaders and institutions from diverse sectors of society actively engaged in organizing to advance the common good.

**Our History**  
In 2013, my co-founder Brandon and I attended the Q gathering in Los Angeles where Erwin McManus asked attendees this question: “What if the church became the human incubator for creating the world’s best future?” That question resonated with us. More than that, it compelled us to action. We believe the church isn't a building or an institution but rather a community of Christ-followers called by God to participate with him as he renews the world.

Brandon had already started several companies, and had taken Zencoder through the prestigious startup incubator, Y Combinator. That experience left him (and his co-founders) far better prepared to succeed (Zencoder sold in 2012). I had also started several companies and served as an executive in others. My background has been in organizational development. That’s when it hit us. As part of the Church, we could pursue the world’s best future by helping make sense of unsolved problems in the world and by catalyzing siloed leaders into relationships where solutions could be born.

In 2015, we started by running an incubation program to help difference-makers launch their ideas into programs, products, and services. In early 2017, we began recognizing that globalization was creating systemic problems that needed systemic solutions. An emerging field of work called collective impact captured our attention, and we focused our mission on making sense of these systemic problems and facilitating shared development of systemic solutions with institutions and experts with deep knowledge and lived experience. 

In many ways, we're a think tank, but we're not limited to research and insight. We're committed to supporting creation-restoring movements. We're an action tank for the common good.

If you find yourself resonating with this mission and vision, we'd love for you to join us. Like any not-for-profit 501c3 organization in its earlier stages, we need financial capital in the form of [donations](https://wayfarelabs.givingfuel.com/general-fund) to fuel our work. We're also currently looking to [connect](/contact) with experts in the following fields: affordable housing solutions, student debt, gentrification, and culture change. 

And if you're experiencing a problem in your organization and you want help making sense of it and developing solutions, we offer consulting services to help further your mission. [Let us know how we can help.](/contact)

For the world's best future,

**Jeff Tanner**  
Executive Director, Sequoia Collective / Wayfare Labs
