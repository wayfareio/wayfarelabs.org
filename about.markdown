# About

**Our Vision**  
By 2030, Orange County will be known for its kingdom startups the way the Bay Area is known for its tech startups.

**Our History**  
In 2014, co-founders Brandon and I attended a Q Conference session led by Erwin McManus, who asked us this question: “What if the church was the human incubator for the world’s best future?” That question resonated with us. It’s true, Jesus Christ is the world’s best future, and as members of the worldwide church, Christ-followers are called to go forth and change the world.

Brandon had already started several companies, and had taken Zencoder through the famous startup incubator, Y Combinator. That experience left him (and his co-founders) far better prepared to succeed (Zencoder sold in 2012). I myself had also started several companies and served as an executive in others. My background has been in organizational development. That’s when it hit us. We could help prepare the church to pursue the world’s best future by creating an incubator for nonprofit and social good startups.

We launched Wayfare Labs in 2014 with our first batch of organizations: The Freedom Movement, The Integrated, and True Blue Science. We’ve also built an advisor network of successful, yet humble startup founders and industry experts who want to give back to a community, and that community is Wayfare Labs!

We would love for you to be a part of that community. Become an advisor, apply to be part of our program, or support us financially.

Thank you,

Jeff Tanner  
Executive Director, Wayfare Labs
