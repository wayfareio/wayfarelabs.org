**Our Vision and Dream**  
Our dream is that leaders across the world would work together to build cities where even the most vulnerable flourish. We envision leaders and institutions actively engaged in creating new organization to advance the common good. 

**Our History**  
In 2013, my co-founder Brandon and I attended the Q gathering in Los Angeles where Erwin McManus asked attendees this question: “What if the church became the human incubator for creating the world’s best future?” That question resonated with us. More than that, it compelled us to action. We believe the church isn't a building or an institution but rather a community of Christ-followers called by God to participate with him as he renews the world.

Brandon had already started several companies, and had taken Zencoder through the prestigious startup incubator, Y Combinator. That experience left him (and his co-founders) far better prepared to succeed (Zencoder sold in 2012). I had also started several companies and served as an executive in others. My background has been in organizational development. That’s when it hit us. As part of the Church, we could pursue the world’s best future in two ways: 1. By helping make sense of unsolved problems in the world for the institutions and individuals feeling the pain and repercussions of them, and 2. By envisioning and creating solutions to these problems by bringing together those institutions and individuals through consulting and summits. 

We call it a collective impact action tank for the common good.

We would love for you to be a part of our community.

For the world's best future,

**Jeff Tanner**  
Executive Director, Wayfare Labs
