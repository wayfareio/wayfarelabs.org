Wayfare Labs offers two programs--Pilot and Launch--created to help founders pilot minimum viable services and launch minimum viable organizations.

## Pilot

Our Pilot Program, which kicks off with a weekend conference, is for founders and organizational leaders to learn how to test their ideas and create action plans to successfully pilot those ideas into minimum viability. It is equally beneficial for new organizations and existing organizations thinking about new program, product, or service ideas. We will address questions like:

* How do you clearly articulate your mission?
* How do you form basic hypotheses?
* How do you test your ideas?
* How do construct helpful pilots?
* How do you integrate the advancement of common good into your business model?
* What metrics should you track?
* How do you prove and communicate impact?

The Pilot Program starts with a weekend of learning and planning. If you're interested, apply today.

## Launch

The Launch Program is all about guiding you to launch your startup. You will build and refine your business model, develop a pitch deck and raise funds, and learn how to become a leader and tell your story. And throughout, our focus is on providing you the practical, emotional, and spiritual support you need to launch well.

* Weekly dinners with successful startup founders

* Workspace (full membership to Wayfare Workspace)
* Weekly appointments with your coach
* Launch Night preparation and presentation
