Wayfare Labs provides four services that help solve systemic problems. We bring together leaders and institutions through consulting, summits, incubation, and resources.

## Consulting
We consult with governments, organizations, and other entities to help them plan for the development in ways that promote the common good.

## Summits
We hold and facilitate summits and forums to address systemic problems that multiple institutions are facing through a collective impact model.

## Incubation
We incubate new organizations formed from our summits and consulting work.

## Resources
We provide resources for everyday people to advocate for collective impact efforts that promote the common good.
