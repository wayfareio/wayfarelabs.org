# Wayfare Labs - Startup Incubator

Our program has three distinct phases, all meant to help startups launch, grow, and transition into sustainability.

**Launch Phase**  
The Launch Phase is all about preparing you to launch your startup. Build and refine your business model. Develop a pitch deck and start raising funds. Learn how to become a leader and tell your story. And throughout, our focus is on providing you the practical, emotional, and spiritual support you need to launch well.

* Workspace (full membership to Wayfare Workspace)
* Weekly appointments with your advisor
* Launch Night preparation and presentation

Cost: $2,000 per month  
Length of Launch Phase: 5 months

**Growth Phase** 
The Growth Phase is designed to help you scale your organization. Itâ€™s not enough to launch. Growth is critical. Without it, most startups die. We want to help you become sustainable. While less intensive than our Launch Phase, the Growth Phase is still vital to your success.

* Access to special work sessions (as needed)
* Workspace (discounted Wayfare Workspace, if needed)
* Ongoing appointments with your advisor

Cost: Variable, depending on each startups needs
Length of Launch Phase: Variable, depending on progress
