Wayfare Labs a few distinct programs. We're currently accepting applications for the Launch program. The Launch program starts twice per year, in the spring and fall (for more information on the program, [see our details page](/programs)). Here's what to expect when you apply:

**STEP 1: Fill out an application online.**  
Our form will ask you about your experience, your idea, and the team you've put in place. Are you early on in your organization's formation? No problem. We accept startups that don't have traction yet. There's no reason not to fill out the form!

**STEP 2: Founder interviews.**  
If your application aligns with what we're looking for, we'll interview the founding team. This allows us to make sure you're ready for the Launch Phase. We love talking with founders, so this stage is always fun for us.

**STEP 3: Selections are made by the Wayfare Labs team.**  
After the interviews are over, we have extensive conversations about who should be a part of our next batch. We take this part very seriously!

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Question: What are you looking for in startup applicants?**  
**Answer:** Everyone brings something different to the table, but in general, we're looking for Christ-followers who have great ideas about restoring Creation. What does that mean? It means we're looking for people who help solve the world's problems in the name of Jesus Christ.

**Question: Do you accept for-profits and nonprofits?**  
**Answer:** Yep! We accept all forms of movements and institutions. We'll even help you decide how to structure your organization if you haven't done it yet. The most important thing that binds all our accepted applicants together is their faith in Jesus Christ.

**Question: Why does the program cost money?**  
**Answer:** We strive to provide a valuable, personal experience for all our Labbers. That means putting together a killer program backed by a great team. That all costs money. Much of that is subsidized by the donations we accept, but we also require startups to pay for the program to ensure we are a sustainable strong organization. But, we do help you raise the funds, so don't be too worried about the cost. If you're concerned, contact us and tell us about it!

**Question: How do I determine whether or not my startup or my idea is a good fit for this program?**  
**Answer:** The best way? Fill out and application or shoot us an email. Most of the startups we bring into the program are early on in their history. Some are even just an idea written down on a napkin. Others are already piloting their product or service or have even been operating for several years. But, most need help with their business models, fundraising, storytelling, and developing their mission and vision. Have a question? We're here to help. Contact us!

**Question: Can I apply for the Growth Phase or even the Transition Phase?**
**Answer:** Good question. Yes? We prefer for companies to go through the Launch Phase first, but there are some organizations that may have a better fit in one of our subsequent phases. Contact us to discuss your thoughts and we'll see what we can do.

**Question: I would love to support Wayfare Labs. How can I do that?**  
**Answer:** First off, thank you! We appreciate it! There are a number of ways to support us. Obviously, we'd love to have you support us financiallyâ€”just cruise over to our giving page to do that. You can also support us by volunteering. If you've founded a startup, you can be a speaker at a founder dinner or you can be part of our advisor network. Maybe you haven't founded a startup, but you do have expertise in another area. You can still volunteer by teaching one of our workshops! Contact us for more information.
